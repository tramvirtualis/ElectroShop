# ⚠️ CRITICAL: YOU MUST RESTART THE APPLICATION!

## The Problem
The changes I made to `home.html` are NOT visible because:
- **The application is still running with the OLD version**
- Browser is loading the cached/old template from the server
- Spring Boot needs to reload the template files

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Restart Application

### Step 1: STOP the application
In your IDE or terminal:
- Click the **STOP** button (red square)
- OR press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- Wait until you see "Application stopped" or terminal prompt returns

### Step 2: START the application again
- Click **RUN** button
- OR run: `mvn spring-boot:run`
- Wait until you see: **"Started HomeTechApplication"**

### Step 3: Clear browser cache
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"

### Step 4: Hard refresh the page
- Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Open console (F12)

## What You Should See NOW

### In Console (immediately when page loads):
```
🔧 WebSocket init script running...
🔧 SockJS available: true
🔧 Stomp available: true
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket...
✅ WebSocket connected!
```

### If you STILL don't see 🔧:
The template changes didn't reload. Try:
1. Stop application
2. Delete the `target` folder
3. Run `mvn clean install`
4. Start application again

---

## Why This is Necessary

Spring Boot caches templates for performance. Changes to HTML files require:
1. Application restart, OR
2. DevTools auto-reload (but not always reliable)

Since the console shows NO 🔧 logs, the old template is still being served.

---

## Quick Test After Restart

1. Open `http://localhost:8080/`
2. Check console for 🔧 logs
3. If you see them → WebSocket should work
4. Click bug icon
5. Should see notification

---

## If Console STILL Shows No 🔧 After Restart

Then the problem is:
1. Browser is aggressively caching (try incognito mode)
2. Template isn't being recompiled (delete `target/` folder)
3. Changes were lost (unlikely)
