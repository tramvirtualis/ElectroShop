# 🎯 REFRESH AND TEST NOW!

## ✅ What I Just Fixed:

**THE PROBLEM:** 
- The stub function in `<head>` was preventing the real function from loading
- The inline onclick was calling the stub instead of the real implementation

**THE SOLUTION:**
1. ✅ Removed the stub in `<head>` 
2. ✅ Removed inline `onclick` from the bell button
3. ✅ Added JavaScript event listener attachment at the end of the page
4. ✅ The real `toggleNotifications` function will now be used!

## 🚀 TEST IT NOW:

### Step 1: Refresh the Browser
Just press **F5** or **Ctrl+R** to refresh the page at `localhost:8080`

### Step 2: Check the Console
Open browser console (F12 → Console tab) and look for:

```javascript
🔧 Loading notification system (inline backup)...
📊 (Inline) Loading initial unread count...
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket (inline)...
✅ WebSocket connected (inline)!
✅ Bell button click handler attached    ← NEW MESSAGE!
🔢 (Inline) Updating unread count from DB...
📊 (Inline) Unread count: 2
```

### Step 3: Check the Bell Icon
Look at the top-right corner. You should see:
- 🔔 Bell icon
- **Red badge with "2"**

### Step 4: Click the Bell
Click the bell icon. You should see:

**In Console:**
```javascript
📥 (Inline) Loading notifications from DB...
📡 Response status: 200
📦 (Inline) Loaded notifications: 2
```

**In Dropdown:**
- Đơn hàng #19 đã được tạo thành công!
