# 🚀 QUICK TEST - DO THIS NOW!

## THE PROBLEM WAS FOUND!
The home page wasn't loading the WebSocket scripts! This is now **FIXED**.

---

## TEST INSTRUCTIONS (Takes 30 seconds)

### Step 1: Restart Application
**IMPORTANT:** You MUST restart for changes to take effect!

### Step 2: Open Home Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8080/`
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Click **Console** tab

### Step 3: Check Console
You should **immediately** see:
```
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket...
✅ WebSocket connected!
```

### Step 4: Test with Bug Icon
1. Look for the **red bug icon** button (left of bell icon in header)
2. Click it
3. You should see:
   - Console logs: `📨 Received notification...`
   - **Toast popup** appears (top-right)
   - **Red badge "1"** appears on bell icon
   - Click bell → notification in dropdown

---

## What I Fixed

### The Issue
`home.html` was **not using** the base layout, so the WebSocket scripts weren't loading!

### The Solution
Added WebSocket code **directly** to `home.html`:
- ✅ Added SockJS and STOMP script tags in `<head>`
- ✅ Added WebSocket connection code at end of file
- ✅ Added toast notification styles

---

## Expected Console Output

### On Page Load:
```
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket...
✅ WebSocket connected!
```

### After Clicking Bug Icon:
```
Test sent
📨 Received notification: {"message":"Đây là thông báo thử nghiệm!","timestamp":"..."}
📢 Showing notification: Đây là thông báo thử nghiệm!
🔔 Calling window.addNotification
🔔 addNotification called with: Đây là thông báo thử nghiệm!
🔔 Notification added. New count: 1
```

---

## If You Still Don't See "🔌 Connecting..."

1. **Hard refresh** the page: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Check browser console for **any errors** (red text)
3. Check **Network tab** → Look for `/ws` → Should show "101 Switching Protocols"
4. Try a **different browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
5. **View page source** (Ctrl+U) → Search for "sockjs" → Should find the script tag

---

## Next Steps

### If it works:
🎉 **Success!** Try placing a real order and check if notification appears.

### If it doesn't work:
Share these with me:
1. Full browser console output (copy all text)
2. Screenshot of Network tab showing WebSocket connections
3. Any red errors in console

## Files Changed
- ✅ `home.html` - Added WebSocket scripts and connection code

That's it! The fix is **very simple** - just needed to include the WebSocket libraries on the home page.
