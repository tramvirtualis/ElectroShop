  - **Added TEST button (bug icon)** for instant notification testing
  - Enhanced `window.addNotification()` function

### 5. Test Infrastructure ✅

## How to Use

### Method 1: Quick Test (Easiest!)
1. **Restart** the application
2. Go to home page: `http://localhost:8080/`
3. Look for the **bug icon** button (red-tinted, left of the bell)
4. Click the **bug icon**
5. Watch the **bell icon** - a red "1" badge should appear
6. Click the **bell** to see the notification

### Method 2: Test Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8080/test-notification`
2. Click "Send Test Notification"
3. Go back to home page
4. Check the bell icon

### Method 3: Real Order
1. Add products to cart
2. Click "Đặt hàng"
3. Check the bell icon on any page

## What to Look For

### In Browser Console (F12):
```
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket...
✅ WebSocket connected!
📨 Received notification: {"message":"...","timestamp":"..."}
📢 Showing notification: ...
🔔 Calling window.addNotification
🔔 addNotification called with: ...
🔔 Notification added. New count: 1
```

### In Server Console:
```
🔔 Sending GET test notification: ...
```
OR (when placing order):
```
🛒 createOrder called
👤 Creating order for authenticated user: ...
✅ Order created successfully. Order ID: ...
🔔 Attempting to send notification: ...
✅ Notification sent successfully!
```

### On The Page:
- **Toast popup** appears in top-right corner (fades after 4 seconds)
- **Red badge** appears on bell icon with count
- **Clicking bell** shows dropdown with notification list
- **Notification** has light blue background highlight

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Purpose | Key Changes |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `SecurityConfig.java` | Allow WebSocket | Permit `/ws/**`, `/api/notify/**` |
| `OrderController.java` | Send notification on order | Added logging, notification sending |
| `NotificationController.java` | Notification API | Added GET `/api/notify/test` |
| `layout/base.html` | WebSocket client | Added detailed logging |
| `home.html` | Bell UI & test button | Added bug button, enhanced logging |
| `NotificationTestController.java` | Test page controller | New file |
| `test-notification.html` | Test page | New file |

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Check | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No WebSocket logs | Browser console | Check if SockJS/Stomp scripts loaded |
| "❌ WebSocket connection error" | Network tab | Check `/ws` connection (should be 101) |
| No notification after test | Server console | Look for 🔔 send log |
| Badge doesn't appear | Browser console | Check `addNotification` logs |
| Can't find bell | Home page | Refresh with Ctrl+F5 |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart application** completely
2. Open browser, go to home page
3. Press **F12** to open console
4. Click the **bug icon** (red button, left of bell)
5. Share the **full console output** if it still doesn't work

Include in your report:
- All console logs (🔌 📨 🔔 etc.)
- Server console logs (🛒 🔔 ✅ ❌)
- Screenshot of the header area showing (or not showing) the bug icon and bell

---

## Production Cleanup

Before deploying, remove:
1. The bug icon button from `home.html` (line ~489-491)
2. The test page `/test-notification` (optional, can keep for admin testing)
3. Console.log statements (optional, but recommended for production)

## Architecture Overview

```
User Action (Place Order)
    ↓
OrderController.createOrder()
    ↓
Order saved to database
    ↓
SimpMessagingTemplate.convertAndSend("/topic/notifications", {...})
    ↓
WebSocket broadcasts to all connected clients
    ↓
layout/base.html receives message via STOMP
    ↓
Calls window.addNotification(message)
    ↓
Updates bell badge + dropdown + shows toast
```

---

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Endpoint
- **URL:** `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
- **Protocol:** SockJS + STOMP
- **Topic:** `/topic/notifications`
- **Message Format:** `{"message": "...", "timestamp": "..."}`

### Notification Flow
1. Backend sends to `/topic/notifications`
2. All connected browsers receive instantly
3. Browser parses JSON, extracts message
4. Updates UI (badge, dropdown, toast)
5. Persists in dropdown until page refresh

### Why It Might Not Work
1. WebSocket connection blocked by firewall/antivirus
2. Browser doesn't support WebSocket (very rare)
3. SimpMessagingTemplate bean not initialized
4. CORS/Security blocking WebSocket handshake
5. JavaScript error preventing client-side script execution

## Success Criteria

✅ Bug icon visible on home page  
✅ Clicking bug icon logs "Test sent" in console  
✅ Bell badge shows red "1"  
✅ Toast popup appears in top-right  
✅ Clicking bell shows notification in dropdown  
✅ Server console shows 🔔 send logs  
✅ Browser console shows 📨 receive logs  

If ALL of these work with the bug icon, but NOT with real orders:
- The problem is in `OrderController.createOrder()`
- Check if the try-catch around notification sending is catching an error
- Share the server console output when placing an order
