ðŸ”§ UPDATED - TEST AGAIN NOW

What I Fixed:
1. Made toggleNotifications global (fixes the error you saw)
2. Made setNotificationCount global
3. Added debug logs to check if SockJS and Stomp are loaded

Steps:
1. REFRESH the page (Ctrl + Shift + R for hard refresh)
2. Open console (F12)
3. Look for these new logs:
   ðŸ”§ WebSocket init script running...
   ðŸ”§ SockJS available: true/false
   ðŸ”§ Stomp available: true/false
   ðŸ”Œ Connecting to WebSocket...

4. If you see "SockJS available: false", the script didn't load
5. If you see "SockJS available: true", it should connect

Then try clicking the bug icon again.

IMPORTANT: You MUST hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) to see the changes!
