# 🧪 TEST NOTIFICATIONS NOW!

## ✅ What I Just Fixed:

1. **Removed the conditional check** - Now the inline backup code ALWAYS runs
2. **Wrapped in IIFE** - Immediately Invoked Function Expression to ensure it runs right away
3. **Added delay before loading count** - 500ms delay to ensure DOM is ready
4. **Updated stub messages** - No more "called before loaded" warnings
5. **Added extensive server-side logging** - You'll see EXACTLY what's happening in Spring Boot console

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Restart Spring Boot

**Stop and restart your Spring Boot application** to apply the new logging.

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Test the Page

1. **Open browser** and go to `http://localhost:8080/`
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Look for these messages:**
   ```
   🔧 Loading notification system (inline backup)...
   📊 (Inline) Loading initial unread count...
   🔌 Connecting to WebSocket (inline)...
   ✅ WebSocket connected (inline)!
   🔢 (Inline) Updating unread count from DB...
   📊 (Inline) Unread count: 2
   ```

4. **Check Spring Boot console** for these messages:
   ```
   📊 API: GET /api/notifications/unread/count
   🔍 getCurrentUserId - Authentication: your_email@gmail.com
   🔍 OAuth2 email: your_email@gmail.com
   ✅ Current user ID: 4
   ✅ Unread count for user 4: 2
   ```

## 🧪 Step 3: Click the Bell

1. **Click the bell icon** in the top-right corner
2. **Browser console should show:**
   ```
   📥 (Inline) Loading notifications from DB...
   📡 Response status: 200
   📦 (Inline) Loaded notifications: 2
   ```

3. **Spring Boot console should show:**
   ```
   📥 API: GET /api/notifications
   🔍 getCurrentUserId - Authentication: your_email@gmail.com
   ✅ Current user ID: 4
   ✅ Returning 2 notifications for user 4
   ```

4. **Dropdown should display:**
   - Đơn hàng #19 đã được tạo thành công!
   - Đơn hàng #20 đã được tạo thành công!

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Place a New Order

1. **Add a product to cart**
2. **Go to cart** (`/cart`)
3. **Click "Đặt hàng"** button
4. **Watch for:**

   **Browser:**
   - Cyan toast notification appears
   - Bell badge updates to "3"
   
   **Spring Boot Console:**
   ```
   🔔 Notification saved and sent to user 4
   ```

---

## 🐛 If It's STILL Not Working:

### Check Browser Console for Errors:

**If you see "401 Unauthorized":**
- The API can't identify your user
- Check Spring Boot console for "⚠️ User not authenticated"

**If you see "Failed to fetch":**
- Check if Spring Boot is running
- Check if SecurityConfig permits `/api/notifications/**`

### Check Spring Boot Console:

**If you see "⚠️ Account not found":**
- Your Google OAuth account isn't linked to a User
- Need to check `OAuth2LoginSuccessHandler`

**If you see "✅ Current user ID: null":**
- User object exists but ID is null
- Database integrity issue
